Starting code for the MATLAB Plate loader guide program.<br>
<br>
Includes a few items:<br>
<ul>
<li>Images that you can use in your GUI</li>
<li><b>PloateLoader.m</b> a class to do serial communication with the real robot.</li>
<li><b>PloateLoaderSim.m</b> a simulator class that has all the methods of <b>PlateLoader</b> but doesn't do serial communication with the real robot.  GREAT for testing without the robot.</li>
</ul>
